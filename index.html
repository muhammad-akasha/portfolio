            <p>I graduated from the UK College of Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy with a degree in Cognitive Behavioral Hypnotherapy. I deepened my knowledge of hypnotherapy by becoming a licensed RTT therapist (Rapid Transformational Therapy) under the guidance of Marisa Peer. I am registered at The General Hypnotherapy Standards Council (GHSC) and General Hypnotherapy Register (GHR).</p>
            <p>Since hypnotherapy is a combination of different approaches, I sought additional knowledge and training in the field of mindfulness practices under the guidance of Sean Fargo by attending his Mindfulness Exercises school. In addition, I have also been a yoga teacher with an international license for RYU 300 for many years now. With the help of exceptional mentors I learned what our minds are truly capable of and what miraculous changes can make when we are ready to tackle breaking outdated thought patterns and establishing new, healthy mental connections.</p>

    <p>My dear Brigita, thank you for doing such incredible work; in my opinion, you are the absolute best at what you do – top of the TOP! I still tear up when I think of how you invested yourself completely in supporting my healing process. You helped me sincerely and unconditionally! You prepared me for and guided me through the process of hypnosis with gentleness, grace and complete steadiness and confidence at the same time. I could feel my body relax completely and a sense of relief came over me, as calmness flooded every cell in my body – a truly divine sensation. And my mind, well, my mind was… I guess the best way to describe it is: it felt like it had just been operated on. How could it be any different, I was unearthing and changing thought patterns I’ve been living with for the past 43 years! Oh my god! Even now, as I write this, tears of gratitude are flowing down my cheeks. Thank you for helping me get to the source of my problems and the subconscious beliefs that have been plaguing my life. I listen to the self-hypnosis recording you gave me every morning and every evening. Sometimes the voice of my nagging ego chimes in, saying: “Why are you listening to this stuff? It’s all a bunch of nonsense anyway, you’re not going to solve anything this way, nothing will ever change for you,” and I kindly yet firmly reply: “My dear ego, it’s my turn now.” . Oh yes :-))) this is how I move forward – step by step, with immense gratitude in my heart.</p>

        <p>I didn’t know what to expect from my therapy session with Brigita, it was my first time being hypnotized. To me, it felt like “falling” into a movie, but you still know you’re safe in Brigita’s caring hands, relaxingly positioned on the most comfortable couch ever. :). Brigita guided me through some important moments from my past that I was not consciously aware of and couldn’t really recollect prior to this experience. Turns out, these instances were turning points that greatly impacted me later in life, an impact I had been completely unaware of. Full disclosure – I cried like a baby. I instantly felt an indescribable sense of relief and pure love. After 6 months of therapy I can sincerely say that it is because of my experience with Brigita that I am now able to make life choices different than before. I react differently, I look at certain things differently, I feel like I am more authentic and I honor my energy. I am true to myself and I am finally me, the me I always wanted to express. To me, this feeling of clarity, inner satisfaction, relief and fulfilment is worth all the riches in the world. It’s amazing how certain things from my childhood were reflected in my adult life. If you want to improve the quality of your life and get rid of everything that hinders you, I absolutely recommend Brigita’s hypno-transformational method.</p>

            <p>In life, we often act in a way we might not want to and behave as if we didn’t really know ourselves at the time. I used to carry around thought patterns that made my life difficult, and I had the feeling that I was often caught in a web of hidden inner impulses that I could not explain. Hypnotherapy with Brigita opened my eyes – or, more accurately, my internal sight. Before embarking on this journey, I tried to resolve many of my unwanted personality traits or personal distress on a conscious level, but it was only through hypnosis that I was able to discover what was really hidden in the depths of my mind. Working with Brigita has been a truly unique experience. My initial feelings of confusion and surprise upon discovering hidden parts of myself were quickly replaced by extremely pleasant feelings of relief and inner peace. I feel like this is me now, the real ME. Brigita, thank you! Because of you, I look forward to all the good things that life has to offer.</p>

                            Yes, hypnosis is completely safe, as it is a natural state of mind that we unknowingly experience several times a day. Guided hypnosis, however, is specifically designed to solve particular problems, since – under the guidance of a qualified hypnotherapist – the process is more intense and deeper.

                            Hypnosis is suitable for anyone who wants to implement changes in their life. However, it is not suitable for people diagnosed with mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or any other forms of mental disease.

                            As the state of hypnosis or trance deepens, the body becomes more and more relaxed, the muscles become loose, our thoughts calm down and a feeling of detachment appears in our minds. It is an extremely pleasant feeling of complete relaxation, which is often described as a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping.

                                Because hypnosis is a natural state of consciousness, it means that anyone can be hypnotized. Only those who resist hypnosis or feel too much fear have trouble transitioning into a state of hypnosis. Successful hypnosis requires an individual’s desire for change and trust in their therapist.

                                Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness that can be interrupted at any given moment, however, because hypnosis is not the same as being asleep, we cannot simply “wake up” from it. But rest assured –  in the long history of hypnosis there has never been a recorded instance of someone not returning to a normal state of consciousness after being hypnotized. Anyone can, with the help of a therapist or by their own free will, transition from a state of hypnosis to full awareness.

                                Hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation in which we are completely aware of what is happening within us at every given moment and where we have total control over ourselves. All of the events and emotions that occur in a state of hypnosis are merely observed, not re-experienced. Your therapist will always be there to safely guide you through the events of the past and the feelings that come up during your session. The most important piece of advice that can be offered to someone who is undergoing hypno-therapy is to trust and surrender – you are safe and nothing bad can happen to you.

                                        When you are in a state of hypnosis no one has the power to take control of your thoughts or your life in general. Hypnosis is designed to help us accept new suggestions into our subconscious, however we always accept only those thoughts and beliefs that are in line with our values, and new ideas we intentionally want to sow into our subconscious.
